**1.** The program unifies L1 with a list of N distinct elements between 1 and M and unifies L2 with N-1 distinct elements between 1 and M that are also different from the ones present in L1. Each element of L2 is equal to the sum of each pair of consecutive elements of list L1. With N = 3 and M = 10, a possible solution would be:
```
L1 = [1, 2, 4]
L2 = [3, 6]
```
We can see that the `check` predicate will succeed, since `1 + 2 = 3` and `2 + 4 = 6`.
