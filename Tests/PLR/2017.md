**1.** The `p1` predicate succeeds if the list `L2` is the list `L1` sorted in ascending or descending order. `L1` must contain at least three elements and can't contain duplicate elements. If `L2` is not instantiated, the predicate unifies it with `L1` sorted in ascending and then descending order. This is done through a generate and test approach: the `gen` predicate generates a permutation of `L1`, which is then tested by the `test` predicate. If the `test` predicate fails, then the program backtracks to the `gen` predicate and a new permutation is generated until there are no more permutations. This is possible since the `select` predicate yields different elements of the list when backtracking.

In terms of efficiency, this approach is poor since every permutation of the list is tested, meaning the time complexity of the algorithm is `O(n!)`.
